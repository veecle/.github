# Veecle

Veecle | All Cars. One Software. Our mission is to bridge the gap between existing supplier components and smart apps running on top through unified software. We provide a platform to tackle next-gen automotive connected & security demands. 

Veecle has 3 different product lines: 

- **NoS**: a 100% Rust heap-free, asynchronous and type-safe runtime for automotive. NoS acts as the gateway that allows Nteract to communicate with the vehicle in a secure and safe way.  This unit is secure by design, updatable over-the-air, and fully testable over virtual pipelines. Designed for rapid and agile development 

- **Nteract:** a 100% Rust Android Automotive & Linux compatible HAL providing secure & safe APIs to communicate to any vehicle. Nteract acts as the security gateway between the non-secure, connected "Android & Linux" world and the in-vehicle highly secure domain. This allows for zero-cost secure integration of HMI and applications 

- **Veecle Studio & Cloud Services** consist of a set of tools that can be used to deploy, test, monitor and manage our instances. At its core, this is a set of secure APIs that allows interconnecting visual tools for development, deployment, data visualisation, data storage and fleet management
